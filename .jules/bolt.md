## 2026-07-11 - Costly Synchronous DOM Access in Iteration

**Learning:** `getComputedStyle` is an expensive DOM operation that calculates all styles for an element. When called synchronously inside a large loop, such as rendering hundreds of grid items, it causes significant main thread blocking and jank. The previous `TEAMCOLOR` function in `index.html` fetched CSS variables dynamically for every single item.

**Action:** Memoize values derived from `getComputedStyle` using a cache map whenever they will be read repeatedly during a render cycle, especially in purely static setups without a modern reactive framework.
## 2026-07-24 - Optimize Rapid Mouseover Events
**Learning:** In a dense grid (300+ items), using `innerHTML` inside a `mouseover` event handler creates a measurable CPU overhead because it triggers synchronous HTML parsing on every rapid interaction. Also, failing to early-return when the same element is hovered causes redundant DOM updates.
**Action:** For high-frequency events like `mouseover`, avoid `innerHTML`. Use `textContent` or modify existing DOM nodes directly. Always check if the target has actually changed before updating the DOM.
## 2026-07-28 - Continuous Paint from Non-Composited Animations

**Learning:** CSS animations on properties like `box-shadow` trigger continuous repaints on every frame because they affect the layout/paint pipeline, causing unnecessary main thread CPU load.
**Action:** When creating infinite or continuous animations (like pulsing dots), always prefer composited properties (`transform` and `opacity`) applied to a pseudo-element. This offloads the work to the GPU and prevents main thread blocking.
